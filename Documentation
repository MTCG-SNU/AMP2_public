[Spin-polarized calculations]
Spin-polarized calculation is automatically applied for convergence test, structural relaxation in below condition.

1) Total number of electrons is odd.
2) Ionized transition metal cation still has d-electrons. That is,
   0 < (# of valance electrons) - (oxidation number) < 10
   Oxidation number is determined from the ICSD information.
   
   
[Smearing]
For structural relaxation, AMP^2 use Gaussian smearing with ¥ò05 eV to obtain reasonable results for all kinds of systems. (insulators, Semiconductors, and metallic systems)
